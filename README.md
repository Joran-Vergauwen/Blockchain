This repo contains the code and the final report of the network analysis made on the early stage of the bitcoin cryptocurrency.


The analysis was performed as a group work for the course 'Network Modeling and Design' at Ghent University. 
Together with the Russian exchange student, Dmitrii Brystov, I analyzed the early stage of the bitcoin network. 
More specifically, the report shows how the bitcoin network evolves into a scale free network, identifies traders, brokers and bitcoin exchanges and gives more insight in how the first bitcoin mining pools originated. 

For a more detailed description of this project, I refer to the report which is uploaded in the repository.

The data that was used for this analysis can be found on:
